 - v11026_Generic_GSM_WCDMA_LTE_IP.sqf
 - Description - use it as a default filter for 73xx and 74xx modems.

 - v11026_Generic_GSM_WCDMA_LTE_IP.sqf
 - Description - use it for CDMA issue debugging

 - v11026_Generic_GPS.sqf
 - Description - use it for GPS issue debugging

 - v11026_GSM_WCDMA_LTE_EHRPD_L1_IP.sqf
 - Description - use it for lower layers debugging.
 - Besides the default, CDMA and GPS filters there is a filter to capture lower layers like L1,
 - Management, MAC (v11026_GSM_WCDMA_LTE_EHRPD_L1_IP.sqf) This captures about 5 times more DM
 - that the default filter but sometimes we need to debug lower layers.

 - Filter throughput test:
 - 0-20secs start the SDK, bringup data
 - 20 secs -1:20 secs (1min) DL 10Mbps iperf

 - DM log reference sizes with different filters and throughput
 - 25M - v11026_Generic_GSM_WCDMA_LTE_IP.sqf  
 - 126M - v11026_GSM_WCDMA_LTE_EHRPD_L1_IP.sqf
