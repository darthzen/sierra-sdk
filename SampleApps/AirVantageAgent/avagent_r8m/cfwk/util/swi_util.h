 * @brief This file gives an set/get/notify API on the device tree.
 *
 * This module provides read/write access to system parameters and settings, as well as
 * the ability to receive notifications when they change.
 * System parameters and settings are addressed based on a predefined tree (the "Device Tree")
 * that organizes them based on functionality.
 * This tree will continue to be developed and expanded as the Application Framework evolves.

/**
* Retrieves a variable's value from the device tree.
*
* There are 2 cases: either the requested path is a node or it is a value.
*
* Leaf case:
* When retrieving a leaf, the result will be put as the single element in a #swi_dset_Iterator_t object.
*
* Node case:
* The retrieval is not recursive: asking for a path prefix (i.e. a node) will not return every key/value pairs sharing this prefix.
* Instead, it will return SWI_STATUS_DA_NODE and the result will be a list of element put in a #swi_dset_Iterator_t object, the list provides
* the absolute and relatives paths to the prefix's direct children.
* Each iterator element will give the name of one sub-element of the requested node.
*
* For instance, if the branch foo.bar contains { x=1, y={z1=2, z2=3}}, a get("foo.bar") will return { "foo.bar.x"="x", "foo.bar.y"="y" }.
* No children value is returned, and the children of y, which are the grand-children of foo.bar, are not iterated.

* @return SWI_STATUS_OK on success
* @return SWI_STATUS_DA_NODE when requesting non-leaf value
* @return SWI_STATUS_DA_NOT_FOUND when requested path was not found
