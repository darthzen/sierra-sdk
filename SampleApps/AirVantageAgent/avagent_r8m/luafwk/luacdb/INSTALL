- cdb-0.75 must be built before you can build luacdb.

- Edit Makefile to reflect your installation of lua-5.1 and cdb-0.75, CFLAGS
  etc. and then type 'make' to build shared objects cdb.so and cdb_make.so.

- Test them by typing 'make test' - there should be no output (note: rts
  assumes that you have cdbmake-sv and lua in your PATH)

	% make test
	./rts | sed ... >rts.out && cmp rts.out rts.exp
	%

- Install cdb.so and cdb_make.so in your LUA_CPATH.

The luacdbdump, luacdbget and luacdbmake-12 scripts are provided as examples
only and do not need to be installed.  For production, use the corresponding
programs from the cdb package.
