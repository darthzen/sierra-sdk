<h1 id="appmon-daemon">Appmon Daemon</h1>
<h1 id="goals-and-context">1. Goals and context</h1>
<p>Appmon Daemon is a standalone executable aimed to manage applications life circles on simple Linux systems.<br /> Appmon Daemon can start, stop, restart or send status of monitored applications.<br /> When an application is monitored by the Appmon Daemon, the Appmon Daemon will run the command (in a new spawned process) and checks if the application stops with an error and then restart it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>INFO</strong></p>
<p>As Appmon Daemon was designed to use simple mechanisms, it cannot give hard constraints on application reboot time accuracy or application stopping time accuracy.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="external-interface-and-usage">2. External Interface and usage</h1>
<h4 id="start-the-daemon">2.1. Start the daemon</h4>
<p>It is up to user/solution provider to find a way to start Appmon Daemon at the device boot.<br /> Some basic ideas: init/rc scripts, cron ...</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>INFO</strong></p>
<p>The daemon has to be started with correct permissions including: opening a socket on specified port, changing uid/gid of processes, changing process priority, etc. As a result, this daemon is very likely to be run using root-like permissions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>usage:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ ./appmon_daemon -p [tcp_port_number] -a [privileged_app] -w [privileged app working directory] -u [user <span class="kw">id</span> to use to start apps] -g [group <span class="kw">id</span> to use to start apps] <span class="kw">\</span>
  -n [process priority to run apps]</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><strong>-p</strong>: tcp_port_number is an optional parameter to specify the TCP port on which the Appmon Daemon will listen to get clients requests.<br /> Must be less than 65535.<br /> Default value is 4242.</li>
<li><strong>-a</strong>: privileged_app is the absolute path to the executable file to use as a privileged app (See specific section)<br /> No default value, if -a option is not given, then no privileged_app will be started, it is not possible to start it later.</li>
<li><strong>-w</strong>: privileged app working directory is the absolute path to a directory where to run privileged app<br /> No effect if -a option is omitted.<br /> Default value: Current working directory of Appmon Daemon.</li>
<li><strong>-v</strong>: user id to use to start privileged app<br /> Can be user id or user name.<br /> Default value is: no change of uid of privileged app, keeping the one of Appmon_daemon</li>
<li><strong>-h</strong>: group id to use to start privileged app<br /> Can be group id or group name.<br /> Default value is: no change of gid of privileged app, keeping the one of Appmon_daemon</li>
<li><strong>-u</strong>: user id to use to start apps<br /> Can be user id or user name.<br /> Default value is 65534(&quot;nobody&quot; user)</li>
<li><strong>-g</strong>: group id to use to start apps<br /> Can be group id or group name.<br /> Default value is 65534(&quot;nogroup&quot; group)</li>
<li><strong>-n</strong>: process priority to run apps<br /> Positive number to decrease apps process priority, value valid interval is [ -20, 19 ]<br /> Default value is to run apps with the same process priority than the one used for running Appmon Daemon.<br /> Note that privileged app priority can not be changed, and will use the Appmon Daemon priority.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>INFO</strong></p>
<p>When an option is given, its value must be correctly set, otherwise the Appmon Daemon is very likely to exit synchronously with an error.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>system return code: 0 if daemon successfully started, non zero if a problem occurred during init phase:
<ul>
<li>1000 if it is an internal error code</li>
<li>errno value if system error occurred</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>example:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ ./appmon_daemon -p 45874 -a /tmp/myapp -w /tmp -u myuser -g 32500</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>INFO</strong></p>
<p>As the use of the term daemon suggests it, Appmon Daemon immediately exits, even when init was successful, then continuing to run in background being accessible using the socket API.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="socket-interface">2.2. Socket Interface</h4>
<p>TCP port will default to port <strong>4242</strong> if not specified in command used to start the daemon.</p>
<p>When the client connects to the daemon, it can send command and get results several times.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>WARNING</strong></p>
<p>The client must pay attention to close the socket connected to the daemon if other clients have to send requests: only one client connection is possible at the same time.</p>
</blockquote>

<h1 id="usage-examples">3. Usage examples</h1>
<p>Given the socket interface, one of the simplest way to interact with the Appmon Daemon can be to use the <strong>nc</strong> aka <strong>netcat</strong> tool usually provided in most of Linux distributions.</p>
<p>Let's start the Appmon Daemon</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ ./appmon_daemon -p 7865</code></pre>
<p>To get some kind of <strong>interactive</strong> mode do:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ nc localhost 7865
setup /tmp /tmp/some_absent_file                           <span class="co">## send this command by hitting enter</span>
prog <span class="kw">(</span>/tmp/sdflklsdjkflsdkjflkdsj<span class="kw">)</span> cannot be <span class="kw">stat</span>!         <span class="co">## result sent by Appmon Daemon</span>
..<span class="kw">.</span>                                                        <span class="co">## you can type other commands</span></code></pre>
<p>To get some kind of client to send command, for exemple to be used in a shell script, you can do something like:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">echo</span> <span class="st">&quot;setup /tmp /tmp/some_absent_file&quot;</span> <span class="kw">|</span> nc localhost 7865</code></pre>
<h1 id="application-life-cicle">4. Application life cicle</h1>
<p>Once monitored by the Appmon Daemon, an application can have several state:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>STARTED</strong>: application is monitored and currently running</li>
<li><strong>STOPPING</strong>: application is monitored and currently running but a stop request has been done on stop it.<br /> (Usually, this state will not be seen by the user, unless stop request fails for some reason, otherwise directly after the stop request, the application state is likely to be KILLED)</li>
<li><strong>STARTING</strong>: application is monitored and currently dead but set to be restarted in usually less than 5 seconds.</li>
<li><strong>STOPPED</strong>: application is monitored and currently dead but will not been restarted: a stop request must have been done to avoid it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a schema about application states with some details on which events triggers state transitions.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/Appmon_Daemon_application_life_cicle.png" /><p class="caption"></p>
</div>
<p>Caption:<br /> Black arrows: commands coming from client API.<br /> Red arrows: internal events<br /> Others remarks:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;exit success&quot; means the app ends using regular means (like POSIX exit call), with status code equal to 0</li>
<li>&quot;exit error&quot; means the app died with some kind of error, it can be:
<ul>
<li>ending with a status code different from 0</li>
<li>die upon uncaught signal reception</li>
</ul></li>
<li>&quot;restart&quot; is the automatic restart of an app after some delay, it's an internal action, no socket API command is involved. See Application automatic restart section.</li>
</ul>
<p>Stopped status can occur because of several causes, next sections explains them more precisely.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>INFO</strong></p>
<p>Child process suspend/resume actions (using SIGSTOP/SIGCONT/... signals) that can cause the child to change its state, are neither detected, nor managed, i.e. suspended application/child will still be reported as &quot;started&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="termination-status">4.1. Termination status</h4>
<p>The termination status is shown in status/list command result in &quot;LastExitType&quot; field.<br /> It is the combination of the cause of the app exit and the state of the app at this precise moment.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/Appmon_Daemon_termination_status.png" /><p class="caption"></p>
</div>
<p>When a SIGCHLD meaning child termination is received, termination status is computed like that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Exit Regular: application was not requested to stop and exited with exit code equal to 0</li>
<li>Exit Error: application was not requested to stop and exited with exit code different from 0</li>
<li>Stop Regular: application was requested to stop and either was killed by receiving SIGTERM (sent by Appmon Daemon) or exited (whatever exit code)</li>
<li>Stop Kill: application was requested to stop and was killed by receiving SIGKILL (sent by Appmon Daemon).</li>
<li>Signal Uncaught: application was requested to stop and was killed by receiving a signal that is not SIGTERM or SIGKILL, or application was not requested to stop and was killed by receiving any signal.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="application-automatic-restart">4.2. Application automatic restart</h4>
<p>The Appmon Daemon will restart a monitored application when it dies if:</p>
<ul>
<li>no client has requested to stop the application<br /> <strong>and</strong>
<ul>
<li>the application died returning a system code different from 0 (this is usually done by calling exit or return from the main in C application, see the application or shell command documentation to get details)<br /> <strong>or</strong></li>
<li>the application died because of a system signal.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>When restarted, the application will keep its id, but will be started in a new process with a new pid.<br /> All actions/configurations on the application (working directory, process group creation, ...) done on regular start also apply on automatic restart.</p>
<h1 id="known-limitations">5. Known limitations</h1>
<ul>
<li>Application list is not persisted, i.e. doesn't survive to Appmon Daemon reboot.<br /> Thus, if the Appmon Daemon stops, you have to restart Appmon Daemon, and then manually restart applications.</li>
<li>Only one client can connect at the time to send command request to the daemon.</li>
<li>Client requests may postpone some actions on application (like restarting):<br /> -if a client send the stop command on a first application. This stop command can take up to 10 sec.<br /> -then a second application dies during the execution of the stop command.<br /> -the 2nd application death will be detected and restart will be programmed only after the end of execution of previous stop command.</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>
